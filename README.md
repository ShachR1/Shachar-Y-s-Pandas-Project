# Shachar-Y-s-Pandas-Project
My final project after studying pandas and EDA.
 The data deals with information about movies and series.
 I analyzed the data from the perspective of a channel manager (invented) who wants to bring new content for the summer vacation.
 At the end, you will find my recommendations, based on what the research provided me and what I concluded from it.

A little about learning at DataCamp
I really, really enjoyed it, it's a great site with good lecturers, and the explanations were very understandable.
Their built-in AI system really helped me when it was difficult and I didn't quite remember or understand what to do.
